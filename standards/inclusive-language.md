# Inclusive Language

## Introduction

We want everyone to feel welcome, and ensuring we use language properly is essential to making Conex a diverse and inclusive organisation.

**Content Warning**  
This article contains offensive/defamatory language demonstrating what is unacceptable.
{% endhint %}

## Avoid ableist language

Problematic ableist language has become part of common language and can be found in many popular phrases. We should strive to avoid using ableist words and phrases such as: 'crippled', 'insane', 'blind eye to', 'dumb'.

| Unsuitable **❌** | Suitable ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Before publication, give everything a final **sanity-check**. | Before publication, give everything a final check for clarity. |
| That amount of data would **cripple** the system. | That amount of data would overwhelm the system. |

## Avoid unnecessarily gendered language

In most situations it is unnecessary to use gendered language. Rather than using he/him/his, she/her/hers in generic references, use gender neutral language such as they/them/their, or refer to them as 'the individual' or by role, 'the user', 'the analyst'.

| Unsuitable **❌** | Suitable ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manned** spacecraft | Crewed spacecraft |
| **Manmade** materials | Synthetic, manufactured |
| Check that **he/she** is ready to go | Check that they're ready to go |

## Don't use offensive language

The use of offensive language is inexcusable, and if used accidentally should be corrected immediately and steps taken to ensure those involved are held accountable and resolve issues suitably where needed.

We highly recommend the [GLAAD Media Reference Guide](https://www.glaad.org/sites/default/files/GLAAD-Media-Reference-Guide-Tenth-Edition.pdf) to learn more about how to use respectful, fair, and inclusive language regarding the LGBTQ community.

Microsoft's guide on using '[Bias-free Communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication)' gives further examples on using inclusive and diverse language in technical writing.
