## Chart design tips

### Mind the gaps

Make sure you leave a gap between your labels, if you can't do this try using a different type of chart.

### Horizontal not vertical

Using horizontal labels makes it easier to read \(and is better for people's necks!\), so avoid vertically labelled charts where possible.

### Simple design

Gradient backgrounds and 3D charts might look cool, but can impact accessibility and make documents look cluttered.
