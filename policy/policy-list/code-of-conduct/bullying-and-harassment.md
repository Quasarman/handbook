# Bullying & Harassment

## Bullying & Harassment Policy

Conex Research is committed to providing a working environment free from bullying and harassment. We aim to ensure that all members are treated, and treat others, with dignity and respect. This policy covers bullying or harassment which occurs at work and out of the work environment, including related events or social functions. This policy applies to all members at all levels including team members, team leaders, management, advisors, and guest contributors.

### **What is harassment?**

Harassment is any unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them.

A single incident can amount to harassment. A person may be harassed even if they were not the intended "target". Harassment also includes treating someone less favourably because they have submitted or refused to submit to such behaviour in the past.

It is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010 to harass a person because of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. It also includes conduct of a sexual nature \(sexual harassment\). Harassment is unacceptable even if it does not fall within any of these categories.

**Examples of harassment include, but are not limited to:**

-       Unwanted physical conduct including touching, pinching, pushing and grabbing

-       Unwelcome sexual advances or suggestive behaviour;

-       Offensive e-mails, text messages or social media content or the display of offensive materials

-       Unwanted jokes, banter, mocking, mimicking or belittling a person

### **What is bullying?**

Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, abuse or misuse of power through means that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. Bullying can include the use of personal strength or the power to coerce through fear or intimidation, not necessarily from someone in a position of authority. Bullying may be physical, verbal or non-verbal.

It can include conduct that is not face-to-face, including via text message, email and social media.

**Examples of bullying include:**

-       Physical or psychological threats

-       Overbearing and intimidating levels of supervision

-       Inappropriate derogatory remarks about a person or their performance

-       Shouting at others

-       Persistently picking on people in front of others or in private

-       Blocking development and training opportunities regularly and deliberately ignoring or excluding members from team activities or team-related social events

-       Setting a person up to fail by overloading them with work or setting impossible deadlines

-       Regularly making the same person the subject of jokes.

Legitimate and reasonable criticism of a team member’s performance or behaviour, or reasonable management instructions, do not amount to bullying.

### Breaches of this Policy

Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in our working environment and all members are required to treat each other, along with our collaborators, advisors, and guests, with dignity and respect. Breaches of this policy will be dealt with in accordance with our disciplinary procedure. Serious cases of bullying or harassment may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal. Members who make complaints or who participate in good faith in any investigation must not suffer any form of retaliation or victimisation as a result. However, making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our disciplinary procedure. Anyone found to have retaliated against or victimised someone in this way will be subject to disciplinary action under our disciplinary procedure.

### What to do if you’re being Harassed or Bullied

If you believe you are being harassed or bullied, you may wish to raise the problem informally with the person responsible. Explain the situation and how it has made you feel. It can be helpful to describe the event, so the other person is clear about your concerns. Use the opportunity to ask the person to change or stop their behaviour. Alternatively, you may speak to a member of the management team who can provide confidential advice and assistance in resolving the issue formally or informally. If you do not feel that informal steps are appropriate, or they have been unsuccessful, you should raise the matter formally under our grievance procedure.

### Relationships

We want to ensure that relationships between members are appropriate and harmonious. We outline our guidelines, and we ask you to always behave professionally.

Fraternisation refers to dating or being friends with other team members. In this policy, “dating” equals consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships constitute sexual violence, and we prohibit them explicitly. If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep personal discussions outside of our working environment.

You are also obliged to respect team members who date each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip and improper comments. If you witness this kind of behaviour, please report it to management.

Employees who work together may naturally form friendships. We encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help you communicate and collaborate, but we expect you to focus on your work and keep personal disputes outside of our working environment.
