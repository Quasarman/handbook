# Misconduct & Investigations

## 1. Purpose and scope

This procedure is designed to help and encourage all team members to achieve and maintain standards of conduct. The organisational policies and this procedure apply to all team members. The aim is to ensure consistent and fair treatment for all in the organisation.

## 2. Principles

Informal action will be considered, where appropriate, to resolve problems.

No disciplinary action will be taken against a team member until the case has been fully investigated.

For formal action the team member will be advised of the nature of the complaint against them and will be given the opportunity to state their case before any decision is made at a misconduct meeting.

Team members will be provided, where appropriate, with written copies of evidence and relevant witness statements in advance of a misconduct meeting.

At all stages of the procedure the team member will have the right to be accompanied by a fellow team member.

No team member will be dismissed for a first breach of policies except in the case of gross misconduct, when the penalty will be permanent dismissal regardless of previous misconduct history.

A team member will have the right to appeal against any actions resulting from a misconduct investigation.

The procedure may be implemented at any stage if the team member’s alleged misconduct warrants this.

## 3. Investigation Procedure

Once a formal complaint is received against a team member, the Co-Executive Directors \("**CEDs**"\) and Operations Director \("**OD**"\) will review the allegations to decide if a formal investigation is justified.

If they agree that a formal investigation should go ahead, this will usually be conducted by the OD, following the investigation procedure:

1. The team member will be notified in writing of the investigation and misconduct allegations.
2. Depending on the nature of the allegation, the team member may be suspended from participating in any activities during the investigation.
3. The OD will gather evidence and statements.
4. The OD will consult with the CEDs whether or not the evidence supports any disciplinary action against the team member, and also if the offence should be considered as gross misconduct.

If the decision is made to take **no further action**:

1. The team member will be notified that no further action is being taken.
2. Any suspension will be reversed immediately.

If the decision is made to continue with **disciplinary action**:

1. The team member will be invited to attend a misconduct meeting, conducted by the OD and CEDs.
2. After the meeting, the OD and CEDs will decide upon what disciplinary action \(if any\) will be taken.

If the decision is made that the offence amounts to **gross misconduct**:

1. The team member will be invited to attend a misconduct meeting, conducted by the OD and CEDs.
2. After the meeting, the OD and CEDs will decide if the team member should be permanently dismissed from the Conex team.

In exceptional circumstances, where either the CEDs or OD are the subject of investigation, the Board of Trustees will appoint two alternative trustees to perform the duties of the OD and CEDs and conduct the investigation.

## 4. Disciplinary Action

### First case of misconduct

A first warning for misconduct if conduct does not meet acceptable standards. This will be in writing and set out the nature of the misconduct and the change in behaviour required and the right of appeal. The warning will also inform the team member that a final written warning may be considered if there is no sustained satisfactory improvement or change. A record of the warning will be kept, but it will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after a specified period \(eg, six months\).

### Second case of misconduct

If the offence is sufficiently serious, or if there is further misconduct or a failure to improve conduct during the period of 12 months of a prior warning, a final written warning may be given to the team member. This will give details of the complaint, the improvement required and the timescale. It will also warn that failure to improve may lead to dismissal \(or some other action short of dismissal\) and will refer to the right of appeal. A copy of this written warning will be kept by the investigator but will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after 12 months subject to achieving and sustaining satisfactory conduct.

### Dismissal or other sanction

If there is still further misconduct or failure to improve conduct the final step in the procedure may be permanent dismissal from the Conex team. Dismissal decisions can only be taken in a joint decision between the Co-Executive Directors and Operations Director, and the team member will be provided in writing with reasons for dismissal, the date on which the participation will terminate, and the right of appeal.

If some sanction short of dismissal is imposed, the team member will receive details of the complaint, will be warned that permanent dismissal could result if there is no satisfactory improvement, and will be advised of the right of appeal. A copy of the written warning will be kept by the investigator but will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after 12 months subject to achievement and sustainment of satisfactory conduct.

### Gross misconduct

The following list provides some examples of offences which are normally regarded as gross misconduct:

●      theft or fraud

●      physical violence or bullying

●      a serious breach of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

●      serious misuse of an organisation’s property or name

●      deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive or obscene material

●      unlawful discrimination or harassment

●      bringing the organisation into serious disrepute

●      misconduct brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs

●      causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence

●      a serious breach of health and safety rules



If you are accused of an act of gross misconduct, you may be suspended from participation normally for no more than five working days, while the alleged offence is investigated. If, on completion of the investigation and the full misconduct procedure, the organisation is satisfied that gross misconduct has occurred, the result will normally be summary dismissal without notice.

The investigator reserves the right to make the decision if an offence should be considered as gross misconduct.

## 5. Criminal & Civil Offences

In exceptional circumstances of gross misconduct where we suspect a criminal offence has been committed, we are legally obliged to inform the relevant authorities without notice.

We also reserve the right to enter civil litigation against a team member regardless of the result of a misconduct investigation where permitted to do so under law.

## 6. Appeals

An employee who wishes to appeal against a disciplinary decision must do so within five working days. The Board of Trustees will hear all appeals and their decision is final. At the appeal any disciplinary actions imposed will be reviewed.
