# Social Media

## Social Media Policy

Social media gives us an exceptional platform to share information, ideas, and experiences, as well as connect with new people around the world. We encourage all our members to share their great work with the public, so to protect our organisation and member’s intellectual property and reputation, we’ve developed some guidelines to follow when using social media.

### **Be respectful, polite, and patient.**

When engaging in conversations on our organisation’s behalf or regarding our work, you must ensure you maintain professionalism and be kind and respectful to all those you interact with.

### **Check before you share internal information.**

Please check with our compliance team before posting any undisclosed information, images, or data. If you’re unsure if you post something, it’s best to check first.

### **Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise.**

To ensure that we provide accurate information about our work to the public, please only respond to questions on topics that you are knowledgeable on. If you feel you can’t answer a question accurately, direct the asker to the main Conex social media accounts.

### **Never post discriminatory, offensive, or libellous content.**

All our members represent our brand, and we must ensure that everyone always represents our values of respect and integrity.

### **Correct or remove any misleading or false content.**

Everyone makes typos and errors, but if you spot one please make sure to correct it as soon as possible, to ensure information shared about our work is accurate.
