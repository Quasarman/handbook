# File Naming Convention

## File Naming

Using a consistent file naming convention makes searching and organising files much easier for everyone, and helps to reduce miscommunication.

### Names

Filenames should be clear and concise, allowing viewers to understand what the file is quickly, and without familiarity.

Capitalise each word in the filename.

### Spaces

Use underscores instead of spaces. This keeps filenames consistent across operating systems/software.

{% hint style="info" %}
This does not apply to Google Docs files, as these exist only within Google Drive
{% endhint %}

### Special Characters

Don't use any of the following characters in filenames: ~ ! @ \# $ % ^ & \* \( \) \` : ; &lt; &gt; ? , \[ \] { } ‘ ” \|

### Dates

For dates, always use DD-MM-YYYY, this is important to ensure dates don't get confused between countries.

### Versions

Where possible, you should replace the existing version with the updated file to avoid confusion. If this isn't suitable, use v1, v2, v3, etc. preceded with an underscore.
