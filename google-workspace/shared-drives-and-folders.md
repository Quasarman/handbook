# Shared Drives & Folders

## Shared Drives

Shared drives are similar to folders, but allow for multiple folders to be easily organised by team. Each team at Conex has a shared drive, which can be accessed by all members of the team. Some shared drives exist for specific purposes, such as for shared resources.

Currently, new shared drives cannot be created by team members. However, if you have an idea for a shared drive that would benefit the team, send it to [ops@conexresearch.com](mailto:ops@conexresearch.com) for consideration.

## Folder Naming Convention

* **Do** use spaces
* **Don't** use number prefixes \(e.g. 01\_Documents, 02\_Images\)
* **Don't** use more than 2 levels of folders \(excluding Shared Drive\)
