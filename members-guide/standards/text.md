British English should always be used. Refer to the Cambridge Dictionary if in doubt: [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/)

Any references to spaceflight, spacecraft or space systems involving humans, should be referred to as crewed, not manned. For example:

Acceptable: crewed spaceflight

Unacceptable: manned spaceflight
