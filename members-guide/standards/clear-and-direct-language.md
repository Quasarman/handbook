# Clear & Direct Writing

We want everyone to benefit from Conex's research, from young space-enthusiasts to academics leading the field. To do this we must use clear and direct language where possible, and only use specialist-terminology when suitable for the target audience.

These are just guidelines, use your own judgement when writing.
{% endhint %}

## Easy reading

* Break up large amounts of text using paragraphs, headings, and lists.
* Use shorter sentences, aim for less than 26 words per sentence.
* Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage, or more than once if used infrequently.
* Place important information in the first sentence to improve scannability.
* Use clear and direct language, avoiding double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.

## **Be concise**

Don't use more words than you need to. Find a balance that makes text easy to read and quickly scan through, while not sounding abrupt or unfriendly.

## Avoid jargon

Sometimes it's necessary to use technical language, especially when writing for academic and industry professionals. However, when writing content for a wider audience, avoid using jargon that can be confusing and exclude less-experienced readers. We don't want to appear like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW2LvQUcwqc).
