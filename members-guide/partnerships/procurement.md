# Procurement

## Background

Any and all members should endeavour to seek out partnerships that might help Conex grow in experience and exposure. This typically takes the form of project mentorship, lectures and workshops run by the partners. However, this can extend to the working time of the company being donated to Conex.

Partners can take the form of companies, research organisations or individuals.

In return, Conex will seek permission from partners to publicise the partnership. We will use our social media presence, conference attendances and press released to publically acknowledge the company, and their invaluable assistance.

## Procedure

As stated, partnerships should be sought by all members. Once a potential partnership has been identified, James McKevitt \(james.mckevitt@conexresearch.com\) should be contacted and a meeting will be organised between the Conex leadership and the potential partner.

A memorandum of understanding outlining the goals of the partnership and including any financial arrangements of the agreement will be agreed between the parties, and signed by nominated partnership leaders. Examples of such an agreement can be found in the GDrive \(at time of writing Space Mission Designathon &gt; 100Business &gt; 30Contracts\).
