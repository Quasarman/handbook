## Tips for great meetings ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» 

* âŒš Start on time - If a meeting is scheduled for 14:00, start at 14:01. Waiting for people punishes those who arrived on time. Remember, time is precious!
* ðŸ“„ Prepare an agenda, and share with attendees prior to the meeting.

## Selecting a platform

We use are Discord and Google Meet for video conferencing, please don't use tools other than this, as we can't ensure data security and team safety outside of the platforms we support. Below is guidance on which platform to choose for different meeting scenarios:

## Video Tips

We recommend turning video on during meetings, it gives helps make meetings more personal and better holds the attention of attendees. Don't worry if your webcam isn't great, a low-quality video feed is better than none.

## Audio Tips

1. Please keep yourself muted when not talking, this prevents background noise and echos from distracting other attendees. \(Don't be offended if the meeting organiser mutes your mic for you!\).
2. Use headphones when possible, they improve audio quality, reduce distractions, and cut echoes.
3. Try to find a quiet place to meet, with minimal background noise.
