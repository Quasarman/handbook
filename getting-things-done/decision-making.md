# Decision Making

## Introduction

It's [estimated ](https://go.roberts.edu/leadingedge/the-great-choices-of-strategic-leaders)that the average adult makes up to 35,000 decisions every day!ðŸ¤¯ For the decisions you make regarding your work at Conex, we've outlined some guidance below to help you make good ones:

1.  Follow [our values](../organisation/mission-and-values/) - If it goes againt our values it's likely a bad decision. ðŸ™ˆ 
2.  [Can I decide that?](decision-making.md#can-i-decide-that) - Some important decisions require approval. â˜‘ 
3.  Look at the data - Use accurate and relevant data to help you decide. ðŸ“Š 
4.  Get a second opinion - Ask someone else what they would do. ðŸ™‹ 
5.  Be conscious of bias - Check unconscious biases aren't influecing your decisions. âš– 

## Who can I ask for help? ðŸ¤” 

This depends on the type of decision your making, or what you need help with. In general, you should use the following flow to escalate a decision making question:

_Fellow Team Member &gt;&gt; Team Lead &gt;&gt; Operations Team &gt;&gt; Board of Directors_

Here's a handy table to show what topics each team can help with:

## Can I decide that?

Most of the time the answer is yes - we try to apply [consesus decision-making](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus) where possible, a method that leaves decision making to teams rather than certain individuals. A big part of personal development is gaining the confidence to make your own decisions, and we encourage this.

For some key decisions that could effect the entire organisation however, we have special policies and procedures to keep us protected.

### Financial Decisions

Any decisions relating to finance must be approved by the [Board of Trustees](../organisation/org-structure/board-of-trustees.md), questions relating to finance however can be directed to the [Business & Marketing Team](../organisation/org-structure/business-and-marketing-team.md).

Examples of financial decisions are:

* Spending and procurement.
* Sale/transfer of assets.
* Charging for products/services.
* Sponsorship/partnership procurement.

### Press & Information

Any information release or press communication must be approved by the [Business & Marketing Team](../organisation/org-structure/business-and-marketing-team.md).

Examples of press decisions are:

* Publishing official press releases.
* Giving statements to the press.
* Releasing any information covered by [confidentiality policies](../policy/policy-list/data-protection/confidentiality.md).

### Safety & Security

Any decisions that would directly or indirectly impact the safety or security of our organisation, team, systems, or information must be approved by the [Operations Team](../organisation/org-structure/operations-team.md) or [Board of Trustees](../organisation/org-structure/board-of-trustees.md).

Examples of Safety & Security decisions are:

* Exporting confidential data.
* Procuring a new IT system.
* Using [special category data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/).
