# Mission & Values

## Introduction

Our official mission statement, as outlined in our Charitable Incorporated Organisation \(CIO\) constitution, is **"To advance the education and personal development of early career professionals through engagement in academic research in the space field"**.

Making a mission statement is easy, but making sure that everything we do helps us achieve that mission is harder. We've established three principle values to help guide us:

## 🤝 Collaboration 🤝

We'll create a working environment where everyone can contribute.

#### How we'll achieve this:

* Provide a quality digital environment for remote collaboration.
* Embrace asynchronous communication and remote working best practices.
* Ensure everyone has access to the resources they need to be work effectively.

## 👊🏽 Diversity & Inclusion🌈

We want everyone to engage and grow with Conex, embracing individual differences.

#### How we'll achieve this:

* Attract participants from a variety of geographical locations and backgrounds.
* Remove barriers to entry for demographics [typically underrepresented in STEM](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/report/sections/science-and-engineering-labor-force/women-and-minorities-in-the-s-e-workforce#minorities-in-the-s-e-workforce).
* Enforce strict Bullying & Harassment policies.

## 🔍 Transparency 🔎

We'll be honest and upfront about our processes and the decisions we make.

#### How we'll achieve this:

* Docuement our processes and policies in this handbook.
* Be honest with team members, and involve them in decision making.
* Ensure accountability is upheld at every level, in every decision.
