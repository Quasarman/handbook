# Phising

Phishing is usually done through email, ads or by sites that look similar to sites that you already use.

For example, someone who is phishing might send you an email that looks like it's from Google so that you'll give them your Google login credentials.

Phishing emails or sites might ask for:

* Usernames and passwords, including password changes
* National Insurance numbers / Social Security Numbers
* Bank account numbers
* PINs \(Personal Identification Numbers\)
* Credit card numbers
* Your motherâ€™s maiden name
* Your date of birth
