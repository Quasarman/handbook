## AutoDelete Bot

Some channels use the [AutoDelete bot](https://github.com/riking/AutoDelete) to automatically remove messages either after a set period of time after they were posted, or on rolling basis using a channel message limit.

### Why do we use this?

There's two main reasons why we might use the AutoDelete bot in a channel either:

1. **Tidiness** - Sometimes channels are only used for temporary messages or commands, which can safely be deleted after a set amount of time.
2. **Encourage documentation** - Fundemental to the success of remote/asychnronous working is that everything is documented, making messages short lasting encourages people to document well, which is beneficial for everyone in the future.

### Emergency stop!

In some rare circumstances, you might need to stop the AutoDelete bot form deleting messages for an important reason. If this is the case, tag [@Operations](../organisation/organisational-teams/operations-team.md) in the channel and they can temporarily stop the bot while they are preserved correctly.

This should be a last resort however, content of messages should be appropriately documented.
